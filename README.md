# On My Way
On My Way is an intergration between the Esri ArcGIS routing API and Twilio's SMS API. It allows users to input their friends
postcode and number, and then proceeds to take their current location (using HTML5 geolocation) and route to their friends geocoded location. The geocoding makes use of the ArcGIS routing REST API. The drive or walk time along with the distance is then sent via SMS to the friends phone.
